## Miguel Bueno

I'm currenly a Strategist at Google, working within the company's Trust and Saftey division. I examine allegations of policy violations reported by internal and external stakeholders using a combination of tools to gather information and conduct investigations.

Prior to my current role, I workerd as a Quantitative Analyst at Bank of America, where I served on the Bank's Retail Capital & Loss Forecasting validation team.

I hold a Master of  Science (M.S.) in Applied Economics and Finance from the University of California, Santa Cruz. I also hold both a Bachelor's of Arts (B.A.) in Economics and a Bachelor's of Science (B.S.) in Mathematics-Statistics from the California State University, Fresno. I see economics as a source of inspiration for interesting math problems but also view it as a tool that can help us better understand and improve the world. To that end, my interests primarily lie in econometrics and computation.
